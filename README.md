This is a weather update simple flask web application which has been completed by using weather api provided by weatherapi.com.

In this app, I have integrated external api in flask environment.
url navigation and search has been implemented.
It has got two html pages viz. base.html and details.html.
base.html contains search bar with which we can find the weather information of different places on earth.
base.html is handled by home handler {def home(): ... }
On triggering search button, it redirects you to details page on which information related to the entered place are displayed.
